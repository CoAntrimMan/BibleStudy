#Passover is the remembrance of when God took you out of trouble.

Nothing is really sacrifice. It is all things God has already given us.

Joseph was the first Jewish Slave into Egypt.
His bones were also carried out of Egpyt but not the bones of the other tribes heads.

Social Structures being removed has removed our collective story telling and remembrance.

--------

Genesis 26.
Issac digs the wells of his father and is blessed.
A well called Contention 
A well called Rehoboth - Lord made room and blessed him
A well called Shebah... Beer-She-ba

Note how we start the chapter with Isaac loving Rebekah but finish it with him taking wifes of the Hittites and grief in his marriage.

Genesis 32 -"Wrestling with God"
Jacob become Israel.

Jacob asked for a Blessing and Received it.
He had received the blessing from his father Isaac after deceit.
At that stage he was not viewed as being a strong man jet here we have a picture of his wrestling.
His 20 years with trial and hard work under Laban had made him a man.
Before he had been mothered and a soilt child.

## Psalm 118
**Give thanks unto the Lord**
- he is Good
- enduring mercy

Who:
- Israel
- Aaron
- Them that fear the Lord

## RBP 2024
Ephesians 2: 1-10

Note:
v1 - Our condition before being saved

Result of that condition 2-3

vs 4-7 - But God - the intervention of God
throught the work of Christ

Grace - 7-8

9-10 - unto good works...

# The provision of God
Opened the scriptures to 2 Kings 3:

Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.
For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain: yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye and your cattle, and your beasts.
And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord.

# Psalm 5
Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation.

vs 1-3 - David acknowleding God as Lord, my King and my God.
He speaks of his words, meditation, cry and prayer.
He seeks the 
ear of God.
Consideration
Hearken unto my cry

In verse 3 we have a commitment from David - in the morning.
Look up. - His eyes. His voice, His mind.

# Proverbs 11: 28-30
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: 

The righteous is a tree of life;
and he that winneth souls is wise.

Who is the only redeemer of God's Elect?
Christ Jesus.

# Ephesians 6
The Whole Armour of God

The command:
Be Strong in the Lord

Put on the whole armour - not part

Why: wiles of the devil. Spiritual warfare.
So that we can stand!

Open our mouths boldly to proclaimer the Gospel

- Loins girt with Truth
- Breastplate of Righteousness
- Feet - preparation of the Gospel
- Above All
- Shield of Faith
- Helmet of Salvation
- Sword of the Spirit - The Word of God

Praying always

Psalm 18:30
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him

Isaiah 59
15: Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.

The Lord was displeased that there was no judgement.
There was no man.
There was no intercessor.
His arm brought salvation.
His rigtheousness sustained him.

He put on the righteousness as a breastplate.
Helmet of salvation.
Garments of vengence.
Cloke of zeal.
