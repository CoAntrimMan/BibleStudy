#Passover is the remembrance of when God took you out of trouble.

Nothing is really sacrifice. It is all things God has already given us.

Joseph was the first Jewish Slave into Egypt.
His bones were also carried out of Egpyt but not the bones of the other tribes heads.

Social Structures being removed has removed our collective story telling and remembrance.

--------

Genesis 26.
Issac digs the wells of his father and is blessed.
A well called Contention 
A well called Rehoboth - Lord made room and blessed him
A well called Shebah... Beer-She-ba

Note how we start the chapter with Isaac loving Rebekah but finish it with him taking wifes of the Hittites and grief in his marriage.

Genesis 32 -"Wrestling with God"
Jacob become Israel.

Jacob asked for a Blessing and Received it.
He had received the blessing from his father Isaac after deceit.
At that stage he was not viewed as being a strong man jet here we have a picture of his wrestling.
His 20 years with trial and hard work under Laban had made him a man.
Before he had been mothered and a soilt child.
