## Chapter 21
**Christ's ride into Jerusalem**

**The Ass and Colt**
Zechariah 9:9
"Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion; 
shout O Daughter of Jerusalem:
Behold thy King cometh unto thee: 
he is just, 
and having salvation (saving himsef)
lowly,
and riding upon an ass
and upon a colt the foal of an ass

**Meek**
Matthew uses the word #meek. Meek is not incapable but being able to know when to use power.
The meek shall inherit the earth.

**Entry into Jerusalem**
**Ho-san-na** - "save now"

**Laying down of clothes and branches**. -Laying all down at his feet.
No greater love than this...


**The city moved** to ask who he is. Is there something here around how we present Jesus and causing others to notice and ask?
Moved moved but all in different ways. Some to joy, thinking of the consolation of Israel. Others out of evny

**Temple Overturned**
vs 12 onwards.
When Christ comes into Jerusalem the first place he goes is to the temple.
_Mark11_  

Reading during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Controversy over the opening ceremoney and the mockery of the last supper.

**Righteous Anger**
John McArthur book - "The Jesus you can't ignore".
While many would often ask "What would Jesus do?" they often assume that Jesus was often weak and only ever demonstrated compassion.

We see his anger on many occasions to the people, the disciples and of course the religious leaders - see the People and Places folder.

There is a time and place for righteous anger but we also need to balance that with discernment and not have it as a default reaction

**Court of the Gentiles**
The Temple - see Temple.md

David has been stopped building the first temple.
Herod has extended the second temple extensively.. but for his own Glory and favour with the people.

The place that was for the stranger was turned into a busy business and making profit.

**A House of Prayer**
Matthew 21v13 - Christ quotes from
Isaiah 56v7
In my Bible the headinng is "The happy state of believers" + "Of Sanctification".

Speaking of keeping the sabbath and also the Kingdom when those who were previously cut off are no longer.
The **eunch**. Believers of covenant / progressive covenant highlight the mulitple reference to the eunch here and then the emphasis on the Eithiopian Eunch who is saved in Acts. A sign that the Kingdom has been restored - at least in part here on the earth.

_7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people._

Another clear link here to the court of the Gentiles

**Blind and Lame healed**
Are there any other group healed more than the blind and lame?
Blindness was clearly a relatively common issue in this time then we have today with modern medicine and even glasses! - we should always be thankful for the widom given to docter and nurses and others.

Disability has always been a part of the human existance since the fall in the garden of Eden.
What is the first condition like this that we read about in scripture?
as
In Genesis 4 we still read about the ability of many...
the dimming of the eyes of Isaac in Genesis 27 is possibly the first we read about a 'disability'

**Children**
vs 15/16 we read about the children crying and singing Hosanna (save now) in the temple... yet the chief priests were sore displeased.

Are we encouraging our children to be in the temple?
Are we encouraging our children when they want to cry unto the Lord in praise.
Do we realise that the child-like faith is capable of more than our own and that the Lord uses children.
Psalm 8v2 should have been familiar to the priest.

When we consider all of creation - "thy heavens" are we not all as children?

**Christ Hungered - The fruitless Fig tree**
It is easy to jump to the account of the fruitless fig tree but Matthew records a couple of notable things.

When thinking about the broader question of who Jesus is, Matthew progressively reveals that he is God. Yet throughout we also have the record of him being the God Man.

vs 17-18 - record that he needed lodging. He needed somewhere to rest/sleep.
He also got hungry!
...Westminister Confession..

"Of Christ the Mediator"
.."take upon Him man's nature, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin."

Cursing of the Fruitless Fig Tree
Challenge by the chief priest and elders about this authority.
His power was undenyable so they challenged its source.
They did not understand that they themselves were the fruitless fig tree

**Asking and Receiving**
vs 22 "and all things, whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive"

**Luke** 11 gives us the:

Ask
Seek
Knock

**Psalm 107** gives 4 situations when peopl cry unto the Lord and are delivered - but as a Last Resort.

In Daniel when Darius signed the decree of those who wanted to trick Daniel has the decree mention a ban on those asking of any other God.
We have seen the attempts to stop people even praying outside abortion centre today but in general we have no such restrictions. Would we stand against them if they are imposed?

**The Question of Authority**
This is really a trick question from the religious leaders.
They were mostly concerned about him overturning their authority in the temple - Chirst had just come in and over thrown the tables and won the favour of the children.
When he returns they were ready for him, or so they thought!

They actually ask two questions

- By what authority
- Who gave him the authority

There is the source of the power and the ability to use that power.

Remember how Peter and John handled the lame man at the temple
"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk"

Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.

All to God's Glory.

Exodus 3 - Moses at the burning bush
They shall say unto me 'What is his name?'
The Israelites in Egypt had forgetting who the Lord was.

"I AM" hath sent me.

Moses' rod was the sign of his authority. The connection between earth and heaven. He acted as the mediator.

Pharoh says he knows not the Lord and will not let the people go.

In Daniel the 3 friend refused to bow to the image and in Daniel 3:15 - 
'who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

The ruling authorities do not respect the Lord and do not like their authority being challenged.

Daniel 4: Nebuchadnezzar worships the Lord.

The Question posed by Christ - John's authority...

When we think about our own judicial system, the legal positions are called for their source - "Queen's Council" "King's Council".

"by the power invested in me" is used by the likes of wedding officials to deem that they are performing the judgement or act under a regional power.

"invested in me" denotes that the person has been granted that authority. They have met the requirement and/or training for the role.

King of Kings and Lord of Lord.
The Alpha and the Omega.
He who sits in heaven.

It also has to make us consider his judgement, because with authority comes the idea of rule and justice.
Matthew is all about his Kingship.

**Who gave him the Authority?**
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased - hear him!
John the Baptist said that he was the forerunner.

Malachi 3:1 - Behold I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me and the LORD whom ye seek, **shall suddenly come to his temple**!

Christ's second coming - with power and authority and Judgement..

Malachi 2:8 - we are told about the priest, how they have departed out of the way, causing many to stumble and corrupted the covenant of Levi.

Thinking about Moses in Exodus 34.
The 1st time he came down the mount with the law ended in judgement, as the people worshipped the golden calf.
The 2nd time he came down with a message of peace.

With Christ things are reversed. His 1st coming was in peace
His second will be in judgement.

**Psalm 5** - Speaks of the wicked and the house of prayer, those that will stand before the Lord.

**"Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels"**
This is what Christ does here in Matthew 21.

The heart of the priests and elders revealed.
In vs 25-27 we see their thinking - their selfishness.

Also a challenge to the unbeliever - What think ye of Christ?
Are you afraid that you know the truth but refuse to believe it?
Are you afraid of the people around you that give you the power and position that you have.

Where did the priests and elders get their authority?
The priestly lines had been lost. Many had simply claimed to be descendents?
- Research more.

Christ answers with parables.

Husbandman's two son.
- One refused but then repented and went
- Second said he would go but did not

Which did the will of his father?

Christ then draws on their thinking around John - he knew their thinking again and tackles it.

The wicked husbandmen.
- Given the duty by the land owner
- Beat and killed the servants - John and the prohets
- Finally sent His Son and they killed him to seize his inheritance
- They did not reverence the Son.

What will happen?
The Landowner will destroy the wicked husbandmen and replace them with others who will bring forth his fruit.

Link to an arguement for replacement theology.
But it was not the full people but rather the leaders and religious rulers.
