#transfiguration

The chapter break here makes us miss the follow on from the prediction in Matt 16v28 where Christ said that some standing there (6 days before) would not see death until they see the son of man come into his kingdom

#peter #james #john are the inner circle of the #disciples 
Jesus takes them into a mountain apart

Alongside the transfgured Jesus they see #moses and #elijah Elisa in conversation with Jesus.
I wonder what they are talking about?

#father confirms who Christ is. Hear him.

Jesus #touched them.

#disciples asked him a question based on what the #scribes teachings - John the Baptist.
Same issues as pre the reformation when people depended on the scripture being taught by the religious leaders. Are we doing our own study and communion with God?
