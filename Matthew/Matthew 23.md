**Overall them of reproving the scribes and pharisees**

1st Reminder of the position / office they occupy - the seat of Moses
- The seat of the Law that should still be observed.
God places people in authority, wither they be good or bad we still repect the office and how it should be.

but that does not mean we follow their error
"But do not after their work"

Remembering the offices of Christ - Prophet, Priest and King.
The only one who could fulllfil them correctly.
