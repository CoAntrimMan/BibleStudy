**Overall them of reproving the scribes and pharisees**

1st Reminder of the position / office they occupy - the seat of Moses
- The seat of the Law that should still be observed.
God places people in authority, wither they be good or bad we still repect the office and how it should be.

but that does not mean we follow their error
**"But do not after their work"**

Remembering the offices of Christ - Prophet, Priest and King.
The only one who could fullfil them correctly.

**"They bind heavy burdens"** vs 4
Reminder how the religious rulers of the day can often place a heavy
burden on the people that they cannot remove
Thinking of the Catholic church and the penitentence and indulgences.

*Matthew 11:28-30*
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest..
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
**For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.**

Proverbs 6:
6, yea even 7 things the Lord hates:

- a proud look
- a lying tongue
- hands that shed innocent blood
- a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations
- feet that be swift in running to mischief
- a false witness that speaketh lies
- he that soweth discord among brethern

bind the commandments of thy father - on thine heart and about thy neck.

How closely this relates to the religious leaders of the time, who knew these verse.

The contrast between faith and works. James 2.
Faith without works is dead.
but the works are as a fruit from the faith. Not as in Matthew 23v5

"But al their works they do for to be seen of men".

They love the high places. They crave and respect and fear of the people - yet they have no fear or reverence of God almighty
