**Overall them of reproving the scribes and pharisees**

1st Reminder of the position / office they occupy - the seat of Moses
- The seat of the Law that should still be observed.
God places people in authority, wither they be good or bad we still repect the office and how it should be.

but that does not mean we follow their error
**"But do not after their work"**

Remembering the offices of Christ - Prophet, Priest and King.
The only one who could fullfil them correctly.

**"They bind heavy burdens"** vs 4
Reminder how the religious rulers of the day can often place a heavy
burden on the people that they cannot remove
Thinking of the Catholic church and the penitentence and indulgences.

*Matthew 11:28-30*
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest..
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
**For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.**
