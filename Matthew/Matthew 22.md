Continuation from Matthew 21

# The Kingdom of Heaven

Christ has entered the city and being challenged by the chief priests.
He has told them the parable of the husbandsman and they want to slay him but are afraid of the people and how they will react.

They continue to cling to their power and not even act on their own conviction (incorrect ones)
Many seek power and will do whatever it takes to retain it.

As we enter chapter 22 there is not record of what they have ask him but it says that Jesus answered them, again he can know their thoughts - just as he knows our thoughts.

He then relates the parable of the Marriage of the Kings Son..

The Kingdom has a King
His Son is getting married. There is a significance to marriage that the world has lost. 
Christ and his bride - the church.

Significance of the dinner - the communion and being fed good meat.

The significance of "All things being ready" for the marriage to take place.

"Tell them which are bidden" and "Many are called but few are chosen".

The Responses:
- 1 made light of it
- 1 put his farm and 1 his business ahead of it
- The rest killed those who bid them

The King sent forth his army to destroy them - vengence
The bidden were not worthy... as many as you can find, bid them.
From all areas, good and bad.

At the Wedding
The King comes to see theh Guest

The Importance of Dress, being prepared.

- 1 with no wedding garment

Bound and cast into outter darkness.

Mentioned
- King - consisent
- Son - briefy
- Servants - several batches
- 1st bidden
- 2nd bidden

**Many challengers**
1 - Priest and Scribes
Challenge on authority - his
2 - Pharisees
In vs 15 they start to make their move, after the Priest and Scribes had been silenced.
Challenge on the authority - in the sense of paying tribute
Note: they send out their disciples first, not even themselves.
Then they challenge on the ressurection, which they did believe in.
Really they challenge him on the scripture - like the serpent did with eve in the garden and satan did with Christ in the wilderness temptation.

We go through times of trial and temptation but need to stand on the word of God - man does not live by bread alone!

Note how John the Baptist and other religious groups had disciples. The model is not unique to Christ.
Just like today people follow teachers and influencers - particularly on social media and how we list our academic qualifications!
"I have a 1st from Oxford (St..)"

It is important to be studying under the right teachers. The Pharisees hard the perception of being biblical.

These Disciples of the Pharisees came with flattering words but wickedness in their heart - Matt 22: 15-22

**Respect of persons and the Tribute to Caesar.**

The Tribute money was a tax
The Tribute coin bore the image of Casear and reference to him almost being like the "son of god" on one side a a priest on the other according to some, from wikipedia the reservse could have been Pax - spring, new life.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute_penny

The inscription reads "Ti[berivs] Caesar Divi Avg[vsti] F[ilivs] Avgvstvs" ("Caesar Augustus Tiberius, son of the Divine Augustus"), claiming that after death Augustus had become a god. 

Different Kingdoms
Rendering unto Caesar for his Kingdom and unto God for his Kingdom.

**Sadducees**
Up next after the priest, scribes, herodians, disciples of the pharisees comes the Sadducees on the same day.

See Sadducees.md 
We are here given context that they did not believe in a ressurection and it is relevant to their question.

The Pharisees usuallly cared what the people thought. The Sudducees less so.
They claimed to focus on the scripture and less on oral tradition, yet Christ again uses scripture to silence them - telling them that they err and know not the scripture. This must have been a brutal claim for them.
They knew it but didn't know it! We could all fall into this danger.

"nor the power of God" - Christ adds this to their rebutal.
Remember what the bible say - I am not ashamed of the Gospel

Romans 1: 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

The Sudducees thought they knew the bible but they were not saved. They knew not the power of God, the Gospel.

The Pharisees see their chance to look better than the Sadducees and this time they send in their heavy gang. - A lawyer - a master in the law (remembering that they had added on many).

### Which is the great commandment in the Law?
Deuteronomy 6 - I wonderful and challenging chapter on the commandments that are to be kept and passed from generation to generation.

The Pharisees should have known this chapter inside out and considered themselves to be the experts in the Law.

Not only does Christ answer them with the greatest but he also gives them the 2nd and combines them together as the important ones.

Thinking on Nicodemus in John 3 who came to Jesus with questions but in a genuine way.
In John 7 Nicodemus is seen as part of the ruling group and challenges his fellow leaders to judge rightly by the law.
In John 19 he is again seen helping to dress the body of Christ in spices and from this we conclude that he was Born Again.

In each instance he is called the one of first came to Jesus by night.
It can be difficult in a workplace 
of non-believers to completely make a stand or even come out from among them.


**On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets**
In this concluding section of Matthew 22 - Jesus starts to wrap up the constant questions with this statement.
All their questions regarding the law and the prophets.
Oh course the Law and the Prophets = The old Testaments. The Scripture.
If you are going to ask a question about the scripture - these two commandments should be examined!

Proverbs 11 - He that winneth souls is wise
Christ is the only redeemer of God's elect and he is on his mission here on earth. He is the ultimate in wisdom.

### Christ's turn to Question
vs42-46

He has once again stumped them and while they were gathered he turns the tables (figuratively) on them.
**"What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?"**
Is this not the most important question, in some ways, for everyone?

They did not view him as Christ but understood that the Messiah would come - thinking again about the Kingdom.

They immediately answer the 2nd part of the question - "The Son of David".
They knew that the line of David was were the Messiah would come from.

Christ follows up by asking them a question from Psalm 110.

"If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?"

At the end of the chapter we are told that no man was able to either answer him or question him...
Wisdom beyond our comprehension.

Q. 4. What is God?
A. God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.
