Continuation from Matthew 21

# The Kingdom of Heaven

Christ has entered the city and being challenged by the chief priests.
He has told them the parable of the husbandsman and they want to slay him but are afraid of the people and how they will react.

They continue to cling to their power and not even act on their own conviction (incorrect ones)
Many seek power and will do whatever it takes to retain it.

As we enter chapter 22 there is not record of what they have ask him but it says that Jesus answered them, again he can know their thoughts - just as he knows our thoughts.

He then relates the parable of the Marriage of the Kings Son..

The Kingdom has a King
His Son is getting married. There is a significance to marriage that the world has lost. 
Christ and his bride - the church.

Significance of the dinner - the communion and being fed good meat.

The significance of "All things being ready" for the marriage to take place.

"Tell them which are bidden" and "Many are called but few are chosen".

The Responses:
- 1 made light of it
- 1 put his farm and 1 his business ahead of it
- The rest killed those who bid them

The King sent forth his army to destroy them - vengence
The bidden were not worthy... as many as you can find, bid them.
From all areas, good and bad.

At the Wedding
The King comes to see theh Guest

The Importance of Dress, being prepared.

- 1 with no wedding garment

Bound and cast into outter darkness.

Mentioned
- King - consisent
- Son - briefy
- Servants - several batches
- 1st bidden
- 2nd bidden

**Many challengers**
1 - Priest and Scribes
Challenge on authority - his
2 - Pharisees
In vs 15 they start to make their move, after the Priest and Scribes had been silenced.
Challenge on the authority - in the sense of paying tribute
Note: they send out their disciples first, not even themselves.
Then they challenge on the ressurection, which they did believe in.
Really they challenge him on the scripture - like the serpent did with eve in the garden and satan did with Christ in the wilderness temptation.

We go through times of trial and temptation but need to stand on the word of God - man does not live by bread alone!
