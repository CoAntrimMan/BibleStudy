Continuation from Matthew 21

# The Kingdom of Heaven

Christ has entered the city and being challenged by the chief priests.
He has told them the parable of the husbandsman and they want to slay him but are afraid of the people and how they will react.

They continue to cling to their power and not even act on their own conviction (incorrect ones)
Many seek power and will do whatever it takes to retain it.

As we enter chapter 22 there is not record of what they have ask him but it says that Jesus answered them, again he can know their thoughts - just as he knows our thoughts.

He then relates the parable of the Marriage of the Kings Son..

The Kingdom has a King
His Son is getting married. There is a significance to marriage that the world has lost. 
Christ and his bride - the church.

Significance of the dinner - the communion.
