Focuses on the Kingdom
Theme of - Who is Jesus?

## Chapter 1:
Generations from Abraham -> birth

Angel -> Mary
Emmanuel - God with us.
Jesus - for he shall save his people from their sins.

## Chapter 2:

Wise men - knew he was significant - King of the Jews

Herod - Asked the #scribes about Christ
Scribes - reference the OT.

## Chapter 3:
John the Baptist
Foretells of Christ, Kingdom and Judgement

Jesus himself - baptised
God the Father - This is my beloved Son.

## Chapter 4:
Satan - "If thou be the son of God"... seeking signs.

Calls his first disciples

## Chapters 5-7 
Sermon on the mount.

## Chapter 8:
Leapers - Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make us clean
Told them to only tell the priests

Centurion - sick servant

Many miracles of healing.
Jesus declares to the disciples that he is the Son of man

Storm calmed #weather #climate
What manner of man is this?

## Chapter 9:
Forgiveness of sins
#scribes accuse him of blashphemy

More miracles
#Pharisees declare him as prince of the devils

## Chapter 10:
Sending out the disciples

## Chapter 11:
John the Baptist Disciples comes and ask - "Art thou he that should come?"

## Chapter 12:
Lord of the Sabbath
Miracles
People ask - "is not this the son of david?"

#Pharisees again declare him prince of the devils

#scribes and #Pharisees ask him again for a sign.
The says in vs39 about the sign of Jonah.

## Chatper 13:
Parable of the sower.
Does this relate to the theme here of the Gospel - which is Christ and his work?

In his own country they ask - "Is this not the carpenter's son?"

## Chatper 14:
Herod the tetrarch "This is John the Baptist"
account of John death.

Feeding of the 5000.

Storm and walking on the water. #weather 
(They knew the signs - this was not a normal storm)

"Of a truth thou art the son of God"

## Chatper 15
#Pharisees again refer to their laws
Woman of Canaan - have mercy on me thou son of david

Feeding of the 4000

Then [[Matthew 16.md]]

#Pharisees and #Sadducees again ask for a sign - tempting

Beware the leaven of the #Pharisees 
Disciplies themselves misunderstand

Peter's confession of Christ
"but whom say ye that I am?"

Rock to build the church.

Christ foretold of this death - more clearly again - progressive revelation?
"get behind me Satan"

## Chapter 17:
Transfiguration
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him".

Tribute Money to Ceasar.

## Chapter 18:
"My Father"
Humilty and Forgiveness

## Chapter 19:
#Pharisees come questioning him again on the law.
Suffer the little Children.
Rich young ruler "Good Master"

Camel eye of the needle.

## Chapter 20:
The Kingdom
Labourers hired from early in the morning to the 11th hour.
The last shall be first and the first shall be last
For many are called but few are chosen.

Going up to Jerusalem - at Jericho (we later see in vs 29)
Jesus takes the twelve - explicitly called the twelve apart.
Twelve is significant - symbollic of the Kingdom and the 12 Tribes.

Christ reveals more explicit details of 'his passion'
betrayal, death on the cross and resurrection.
Progressive revelation of not just who he is but his purpose.

Betrayal - someone close. 
All people groups involved.

Investigate further.

**Mocked** - is explicitly called out.
"Save thyself"
"King of the Jews"

Olympic Christian mockery should be no surprise.

This week I have been reading in Matthew's Gospel account and yesterday morning hit this section where Christ reveals more details (remarkable details) about his crucifixion.

"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."
Matthew 20 : 19

It struck me that mocking was specifically listed.
The Olympic opening ceremony continued that theme and I see many commenting on it, but remember Christ also warned that the world would hate us but ...

"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
Galatians 6 : 7


**Jericho**
Places can hold significance, evoke memories of historical events.
Remember this is the road on which the good samaritan is told about.

**The sons of Zebedee**
The mother of James and John
Their mother is specifically called out.

She came worshipping, Christ knew she wanted something and asks.
She has awareness of the Kingdom and requests for places of honour for her sons.
Is this just the natural desire of a mother?

Sitting at the left and right hand.
Acknowledging Christ as King.

Christ mentions his Father - did they know who he meant?

Humility and service over power.
The power dynamic argued for by the post modernist is here challenged.

Christ didn't come to be served but to service - The servant king.

Dispute among the group

**Ransom for many**
Christ gave his life for the many who will be saved.
Matthew records a similar statement in 26:28

**Asking**
The mother of James and John is something critized for her ask but as we see with the blnd men calling out, Christ is used to people asking and he often answers and meets their request.


**Blindness**
Is there significance in the blindness and sight given to the two men vs James and John and the disciples.

**Two are better than one**
There are two blind men.
Jesus sent out the Disciples in pairs.
It is good to have friends of a similar state

**Son of David**
The blind men acknowledge him as Christ. They know the messiah would come from David.

Open our eye Lord!

**Compassion and Touch**
Throughout his ministry his compassion and touch are highlights on several occasions.
God remembers his promises

## Chapter 21
**Christ's ride into Jerusalem**

**The Ass and Colt**
Zechariah 9:9
"Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion; 
shout O Daughter of Jerusalem:
Behold thy King cometh unto thee: 
he is just, 
and having salvation (saving himsef)
lowly,
and riding upon an ass
and upon a colt the foal of an ass

**Meek**
Matthew uses the word #meek. Meek is not incapable but being able to know when to use power.
The meek shall inherit the earth.

**Entry into Jerusalem**
**Ho-san-na** - "save now"

**Laying down of clothes and branches**. -Laying all down at his feet.
No greater love than this...


**The city moved** to ask who he is. Is there something here around how we present Jesus and causing others to notice and ask?
Moved moved but all in different ways. Some to joy, thinking of the consolation of Israel. Others out of evny

**Temple Overturned**
vs 12 onwards.
When Christ comes into Jerusalem the first place he goes is to the temple.
_Mark11_  

Reading during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Controversy over the opening ceremoney and the mockery of the last supper.

**Righteous Anger**
John McArthur book - "The Jesus you can't ignore".
While many would often ask "What would Jesus do?" they often assume that Jesus was often weak and only ever demonstrated compassion.

We see his anger on many occasions to the people, the disciples and of course the religious leaders - see the People and Places folder.

There is a time and place for righteous anger but we also need to balance that with discernment and not have it as a default reaction

**Court of the Gentiles**
The Temple - see Temple.md

David has been stopped building the first temple.
Herod has extended the second temple extensively.. but for his own Glory and favour with the people.

The place that was for the stranger was turned into a busy business and making profit.

**A House of Prayer**
Matthew 21v13 - Christ quotes from
Isaiah 56v7
In my Bible the headinng is "The happy state of believers" + "Of Sanctification".

Speaking of keeping the sabbath and also the Kingdom when those who were previously cut off are no longer.
The **eunch**. Believers of covenant / progressive covenant highlight the mulitple reference to the eunch here and then the emphasis on the Eithiopian Eunch who is saved in Acts. A sign that the Kingdom has been restored - at least in part here on the earth.

_7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people._

Another clear link here to the court of the Gentiles

**Blind and Lame healed**
Are there any other group healed more than the blind and lame?
Blindness was clearly a relatively common issue in this time then we have today with modern medicine and even glasses! - we should always be thankful for the widom given to docter and nurses and others.

Disability has always been a part of the human existance since the fall in the garden of Eden.
What is the first condition like this that we read about in scripture?
as
In Genesis 4 we still read about the ability of many...
the dimming of the eyes of Isaac in Genesis 27 is possibly the first we read about a 'disability'

**Children**
vs 15/16 we read about the children crying and singing Hosanna (save now) in the temple... yet the chief priests were sore displeased.

Are we encouraging our children to be in the temple?
Are we encouraging our children when they want to cry unto the Lord in praise.
Do we realise that the child-like faith is capable of more than our own and that the Lord uses children.
Psalm 8v2 should have been familiar to the priest.

When we consider all of creation - "thy heavens" are we not all as children?

**Christ Hungered - The fruitless Fig tree**
It is easy to jump to the account of the fruitless fig tree but Matthew records a couple of notable things.

When thinking about the broader question of who Jesus is, Matthew progressively reveals that he is God. Yet throughout we also have the record of him being the God Man.

vs 17-18 - record that he needed lodging. He needed somewhere to rest/sleep.
He also got hungry!
...Westminister Confession..

"Of Christ the Mediator"
.."take upon Him man's nature, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin."

Cursing of the Fruitless Fig Tree
Challenge by the chief priest and elders about this authority.
His power was undenyable so they challenged its source.
They did not understand that they themselves were the fruitless fig tree

**Asking and Receiving**
vs 22 "and all things, whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive"

**Luke** 11 gives us the:

Ask
Seek
Knock

**Psalm 107** gives 4 situations when peopl cry unto the Lord and are delivered - but as a Last Resort.

In Daniel when Darius signed the decree of those who wanted to trick Daniel has the decree mention a ban on those asking of any other God.
We have seen the attempts to stop people even praying outside abortion centre today but in general we have no such restrictions. Would we stand against them if they are imposed?

**The Question of Authority**
This is really a trick question from the religious leaders.
They were mostly concerned about him overturning their authority in the temple - Chirst had just come in and over thrown the tables and won the favour of the children.
When he returns they were ready for him, or so they thought!

They actually ask two questions

- By what authority
- Who gave him the authority

There is the source of the power and the ability to use that power.

Remember how Peter and John handled the lame man at the temple
"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk"

Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.

All to God's Glory.

Exodus 3 - Moses at the burning bush
They shall say unto me 'What is his name?'
The Israelites in Egypt had forgetting who the Lord was.

"I AM" hath sent me.

Moses' rod was the sign of his authority. The connection between earth and heaven. He acted as the mediator.

Pharoh says he knows not the Lord and will not let the people go.

In Daniel the 3 friend refused to bow to the image and in Daniel 3:15 - 
'who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

The ruling authorities do not respect the Lord and do not like their authority being challenged.

Daniel 4: Nebuchadnezzar worships the Lord.

The Question posed by Christ - John's authority...

When we think about our own judicial system, the legal positions are called for their source - "Queen's Council" "King's Council".

"by the power invested in me" is used by the likes of wedding officials to deem that they are performing the judgement or act under a regional power.

"invested in me" denotes that the person has been granted that authority. They have met the requirement and/or training for the role.

King of Kings and Lord of Lord.
The Alpha and the Omega.
He who sits in heaven.

It also has to make us consider his judgement, because with authority comes the idea of rule and justice.
Matthew is all about his Kingship.

**Who gave him the Authority?**
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased - hear him!
John the Baptist said that he was the forerunner.

Christ's second coming - with power and authority!
