Focuses on the Kingdom
Theme of - Who is Jesus?

## Chapter 1:
Generations from Abraham -> birth

Angel -> Mary
Emmanuel - God with us.
Jesus - for he shall save his people from their sins.

## Chapter 2:

Wise men - knew he was significant - King of the Jews

Herod - Asked the #scribes about Christ
Scribes - reference the OT.

## Chapter 3:
John the Baptist
Foretells of Christ, Kingdom and Judgement

Jesus himself - baptised
God the Father - This is my beloved Son.

## Chapter 4:
Satan - "If thou be the son of God"... seeking signs.

Calls his first discipes

## Chapters 5-7 
Sermon on the mount.

## Chapter 8:
Leapers - Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make us clean
Told them to only tell the priests

Centurion - sick servant

Many miracles of healing.

Storm calmed #weather #climate
What manner of man is this?

## Chapter 9:
Forgiveness of sins
#scribes accuse him of blashphemy

More miracles
#Pharisees declare him as prince of the devils

## Chapter 10:
Sending out the disciples

## Chapter 11:
John the Baptist Disciples comes and ask - "Art thou he that should come?"

## Chapter 12:
Lord of the Sabbath
Miracles
People ask - "is not this the son of david?"

#Pharisees again declare him prince of the devils

#scribes and #Pharisees ask him again for a sign.
The says in vs39 about the sign of Jonah.

## Chatper 13:
Parable of the sower.
Does this relate to the theme here of the Gospel - which is Christ and his work?

In his own country they ask - "Is this not the carpenter's son?"

## Chatper 14:
Herod the tetrarch "This is John the Baptist"
account of John death.

Feeding of the 5000.

Storm and walking on the water. #weather 
(They knew the signs - this was not a normal storm)

"Of a truth thou art the son of God"

## Chatper 15
#Pharisees again refer to their laws
Woman of Canaan - have mercy on me thou son of david

Feeding of the 4000

Then [[Matthew 16.md]]

#Pharisees and #Sadducees again ask for a sign - tempting

Beware the leaven of the #Pharisees 
Disciplies themselves misunderstand

Peter's confession of Christ
"but whom say ye that I am?"

Rock to build the church.

Christ foretold of this death - more clearly again - progressive revelation?
"get behind me Satan"

## Chapter 17:

"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him".

Tribute Money to Ceasar.

## Chapter 18:
"My Father"
Humilty and Forgiveness

## Chapter 19:
#Pharisees come questioning him again on the law.
Suffer the little Children.
Rich young ruler "Good Master"

Camel eye of the needle.

## Chapter 20:
The Kingdom
Labourers hired from early in the morning to the 11th hour.
The last shall be first and the first shall be last
For many are called but few are chosen.

Going up to Jerusalem - at Jericho (we later see in vs 29)
Jesus takes the twelve - explicitly called the twelve apart.
Twelve is significant - symbollic of the Kingdom and the 12 Tribes.

Christ reveals more explicit details of 'his passion'
betrayal, death on the cross and resurrection.
Progressive revelation of not just who he is but his purpose.

Betrayal - someone close. 
All people groups involved.

Investigate further.

**Mocked** - is explicitly called out.
"Save thyself"
"King of the Jews"

Olympic Christian mockery should be no surprise.

This week I have been reading in Matthew's Gospel account and yesterday morning hit this section where Christ reveals more details (remarkable details) about his crucifixion.

"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."
Matthew 20 : 19

It struck me that mocking was specifically listed.
The Olympic opening ceremony continued that theme and I see many commenting on it, but remember Christ also warned that the world would hate us but ...

"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
Galatians 6 : 7


**Jericho**
Places can hold significance, evoke memories of historical events.

**The sons of Zebedee**
The mother of James and John
Their mother is specifically called out.

She came worshipping, Christ knew she wanted something and asks.
She has awareness of the Kingdom and requests for places of honour for her sons.
Is this just the natural desire of a mother?

Sitting at the left and right hand.
Acknowledging Christ as King.

Christ mentions his Father - did they know who he meant?

Humility and service over power.
The power dynamic argued for by the post modernist is here challenged.

Christ didn't come to be served but to service - The servant king.

Dispute among the group

**Ransom for many**
Christ gave his life for the many who will be saved.
Matthew records a similar statement in 26:28

**Asking**
The mother of James and John is something critized for her ask but as we see with the blnd men calling out, Christ is used to people asking and he often answers and meets their request.


**Blindness**
Is there significance in the blindness and sight given to the two men vs James and John and the disciples.

**Two are better than one**
There are two blind men.
Jesus sent out the Disciples in pairs.
It is good to have friends of a similar state

**Son of David**
The blind men acknowledge him as Christ. They know the messiah would come from David.

Open our eye Lord!

**Compassion and Touch**
Throughout his ministry his compassion and touch are highlights on several occasions.
God remembers his promises
