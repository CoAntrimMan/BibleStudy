Hymns
Have you been to Jesus (are you washed)
When I suvery ..
Blessed be the Fountain of blood - Wash me in the blood of the Lamb and I shall be whiter than the snow
I stand amazed in the presence

2 Kings 5.
Luke 4: 24-26, Luke 5 12-14

Naaman' s leprosy

Naaman
- Gentle
- man of status and regard
- used of God
- yet he had a problem
- he is also later revealed as being a proud man - salvation need humbling. It also needs the call of God.
- The maid he proclaimed the word of God but it also needed the call of the prophet of God - not his own seeking to the King of Israel
- Named by Christ!

Naaman's Wife
- care for her husband
- seeking healing for him

Captive Maid
- Taught the things of God as a child
- faithful in her position
- Caring for the gentile people and her master
- Willing to share about the healing power of God

The King of Syria
- Prepared to let him try
- Thought he had to buy the gift
- Thought it needed his letter of authority

The King of Israel
- Seeing the problems over opportunity to witness
- Less aware / Less faith than the captive maid!

Elisha
- The prophet of God - The Word of God in a sense
- Aware of the King's situation
- Immediately requests that it be done for God's Glory - That he might know there is a prophet in Israel
- Sends his servant - not there for self glory
- Refuses the gift

Naaman's Servants
- Reason with him
- Did push to be rewarded for convincing him

Gehazi - the servant of Elisha
- brought up with the man of God daily - yet missed it
- he seemed to be chief of the servants from previous passages
- was only prepared to run to something of self gain
- lied, using the prophet of God as a cover for his own greed
- vs 24 - Tired to do it in the secret place!
- Lied again when challenged
- The sin of Naaman is cast upon him
- What shall it profit a man..


- The problem of sin cannot be hidden
- but if acknowledged there is a cure
- Wash and be clean
- There is only one source of the cleansing and it seems odd to many
- He was as a little child - Born Again!
- Declaration of only one true God!
- Burnt offering? vs 17
- The need for someone to bare the sin!
	- Like the swine where the devils were cast
- Christ bore all of my sin that I could be made whole again.

The Levitical Law - Given to Moses - did anyone ever need that law until Luke 4 when Christ healed the lepers and told him to present himself to the priest according to the law of Moses.

The miracles of Elisha are a clear foretelling of Christ.
Raising from the dead. 
Feeding of the 5 thousand
Healing
