How great Thou Art.

Psalm 8:

Oh Lord our God ...vs When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, thr moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.

Psa 8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

_------



Psalm 19. I could have told you the opening but missed Vs 7-9.

Verse 1 speaks of -- The Glory of God and his handy work --

Vs 7-9

-- The Law of the Lord -- is perfect, converting the soul
-- The Testimony of the Lord -- is sure, making wise the simple
-- The Statues of the Lord -- are right, rejoicing the heart
-- The Commandment of the Lord -- is pure, enlightening the eyes
-- The Fear of the Lord -- is clean, enduring forever
-- The Judgements of the Lord -- are true and righteous altogether

David concludes the Psalm, which starts with the heavens and all creation, with his personal relationship with God - his strength and redeemer.
