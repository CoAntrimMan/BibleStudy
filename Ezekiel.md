#The Prophet Ezekiel

Location: A Captive, taken in the wave after Daniel.
The Lord often speaks during periods like this.

- The Description of fire - God is frequently shown as a consuming fire.
Think about the burning bush and other references

###The Four Living Creatures
- A Man
- A Lion
- An Ox
- An Eagle

Like the 4 Gospels breakdown and the tribes of Israel by their banners

Creatures are like the angelic beings.. of which Lucifier was one.
The others we know are Gabriel (Messenger) and Michael (Battle)
