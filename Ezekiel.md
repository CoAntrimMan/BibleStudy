# The Prophet Ezekiel

Location: A Captive, taken in the wave after Daniel.
The Lord often speaks during periods like this.

- The Description of fire - God is frequently shown as a consuming fire.
Think about the burning bush and other references

Like the 4 Gospels breakdown and the tribes of Israel by their banners

The others we know are Gabriel (Messenger) and Michael (Battle)

## The sound of many waters.
Rev 1:15 and Ezekiel 1:24

## Feet like Brass
Ezekiel 1:7 the creatures feet.
Daniel 19:6 the get off the figure in his vision

## The Word of the Lord

Inspired book.

Creation: Genesis 1:3 - And God said Let there be light: and there was light.
Before this there was darkness and the earth was without form and void

Psalm 119:105 - Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Psalm 119:9 - Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?
vs11 - Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee.
