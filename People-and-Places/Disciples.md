There were Twelve Disciples...or Thirteen..or Fourteen.

Peter and Andrew - Brothers / Fishermen
Peter - Rock

James, John and Philip - also fishermen

Matthew tax collector

Judas - treasurer
Thaddeus - 

Simon the Zeolot - political 

Bartholomew 

Thomas - a Twin



**John 1:**

John the Baptist had his own disciples.
He introduced Jesus onto the scene - "Behold the Lamb of God".

Bethabara - beyond the Jordan

Andrew is the first to hear and follow. Then witnessed and told his brother..
Simon Peter his brother

Sons of Jona.
From Bethsaida

The next day Jesus went to Galilee:
Philip also of Bethsaida

Philip witnessed to Nathanael (Bartholomew)



**Matthew 4**
Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee and saw two brethren.
Peter and Andrew casting a net.
He calls them to follow him and he will make them fishers of men.

John's account helps us to see that they were already aware of Christ and who he was.

Two other Brethren - James and John - mending nets.
Zebedee gets mentioned several times and is obviously a notable figure - their father. The sons of thunder.

This calling is after the wilderness temptation of Christ by Satan.

Matthew 8 we learn a little more about Peter.
He is married and his mother-in-law is sick

Matthew 9 - we read about the calling of Matthew himself.

He has entered into 'his own city' Capernium. Matthew 4:13

Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom.

Follow Me.
Like the Fishermen at their day job, did Matthew already know Christ.
Was this his call simply to full time service and giving up his job.
Did he give it up?
We are told in earlier verse how that Christ had many followers and disciples.
What was a disciple like in those times?
We know John and others had them.

Chapter 9v14 we even have some called the disciples of John asking Christ about fasting and why his do not not.

Chapter 10 va 1-4 - Christ has called his Twelve Disciples

Context: Chapter 9

"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
