There were Twelve Disciples...or Thirteen..or Fourteen.

**John 1:**

John the Baptist had his own disciples.
He introduced Jesus onto the scene - "Behold the Lamb of God".

Bethabara - beyond the Jordan

Andrew is the first to hear and follow. Then witnessed and told his brother..
Simon Peter his brother

Sons of Jona.
From Bethsaida

The next day Jesus went to Galilee:
Philip also of Bethsaida

Philip witnessed to Nathanael

**Matthew 4**
Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee and saw two brethren.
Peter and Andrew casting a net.
He calls them to follow him and he will make them fishers of men.

John's account helps us to see that they were already aware of Christ and who he was.

Two other Brethren - James and John - mending nets.
Zebedee gets mentioned several times and is obviously a notable figure - their father. The sons of thunder.

This calling is after the wilderness temptation of Christ by Satan.
